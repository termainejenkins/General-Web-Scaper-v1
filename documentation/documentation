The encountered issue stemmed from the utilization of CommonJS syntax (require statements) within a file named server.js in a project configured as an ECMAScript module (ESM) due to the "type": "module" setting in the package.json. This resulted in a "ReferenceError: require is not defined in ES module scope" during the execution of the Node.js script. To address this, the import statements in the server.js file were modified to use the ESM import syntax, keeping the filename as server.js and retaining the project configuration with "type": "module". The corrected script successfully executed without errors, offering a seamless resolution to the compatibility mismatch between CommonJS and ESM in the project environment.
